If when you have a GPS position and if you press the left button for 3 seconds the ground altitude is not calibrated, it is likely that you do not have the correct topographic files.

Download [the topographic files](https://vps.skybean.eu/agl/){: style="color:   #f32e49; opacity: 1;" } for your region and copy them to the AGL folder on your microSD card.
