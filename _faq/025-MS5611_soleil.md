The MS5611 barometer on the CJMCU-117 is very light sensitive. Place a small piece of foam or neoprene on the pad to protect it from direct sunlight that could pass through the buttons on the case.

**Be careful** to calculate the thickness correctly so as not to damage the components when the case is closed.

Also prefer a dark colored case to reduce the light inside.
