description: E-Paper screen improperly positioned in the case
---

The E-Paper screen is fixed with double-sided tape on the PCB of the TTGO T5.
If the screen is incorrectly positioned, it is possible to peel it off using a cutter blade to reposition it. You can add a few drops of alcohol on the blade to dissolve the glue.

**WARNING**. The screen is very thin and very fragile. It can be easily broken during this operation. In particular, do not apply pressure to the screen with the cutter. Keep the blade parallel to the circuit board.
