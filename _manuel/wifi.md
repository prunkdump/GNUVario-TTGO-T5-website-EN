**WiFi settings**

Before you can use Wifi with the Gnuvario-E, you must indicate the SSID and password of your Box or your phone

Complete the information in the wifi.cfg file. You can specify up to 4 different WiFi networks.

If you do not want to use the SD card, you will have to complete the variosettings.h file (requires compilation of the code).
