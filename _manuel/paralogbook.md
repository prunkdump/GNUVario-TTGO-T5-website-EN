The Gnuvario-E offers the possibility of sending its tracks and viewing them on the free site [Paragliding Logbook](https://paraglidinglogbook.com).



You will be able to have a flight diary in the "cloud", share your flights, view them in 3D and even relive them!
However, we recommend that you keep your tracks on your SD card and download them from time to time to another physical drive.
