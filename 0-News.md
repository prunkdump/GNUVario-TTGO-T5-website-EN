Some manual pages have been updated
- The ["calibration"]({{site.baseurl}}/manuel/Calibration.html) page to clarify the variometer calibration procedure.
- The ["web page"]({{site.baseurl}}/manuel/page_web.html) page with the latest functionality of the webserver.
- The ["First start"]({{site.baseurl}}/manuel/flashusb.html) page for more information if you are compiling the code with PlatformIO

The 2.9 ‚ÄùGood Display screen (GDEW029M06) is no longer available at this time. As you know there is a  shortage of components in the world at this time. We hope that it will be available soon.
